I am attempting to create a session class to track specific data when a user logs in.

So far in the [models.py] file I have started working on the class Session()
I added some getters and setters to check if the user is authenticated or logged in, etc

I have a state dictionary for each session that will store all pertinent data to a session


Next-time:
    When a user signs up I will initialize the Session my creating a new session object.

    --need to figure out how to pass the session around my server after I create a session object
