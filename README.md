Workflow tips:

1. Start by pulling the most recent repo from Github.
2. Create a branch to work on.
   - git branch "branch name"
   - git checkout "branch name" || - git checkout -b "branch name" does the same thing
3. Work on the branch and write some code.
4. git add, commit
5. Switch back to the main branch
   - git checkout main || git switch main
6. Merge the changes to main
   - git merge "branch name"
7. Then push the changes
   - git push
